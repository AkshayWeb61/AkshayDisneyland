                Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, Inc., formerly Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. and
                informally known as Disney Parks, is one of The Walt Disney Company's five major business segments and a
            subsidiary. It was founded on April 1, 1971, exactly six months before the opening of Magic Kingdom at
            Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, just outside of Orlando.
        <p class="para1"> Originally, the company was known as Walt Disney Outdoor Recreation Division and later as
            Walt Disney Attractions. The most recent chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts was Bob Chapek,
            formerly president of Disney Consumer Products. Chapek was promoted to CEO of The Walt Disney Company on
            February 25, 2020 On May 18, 2020, Josh D'Amaro was appointed as chairman of the division, succeeding
            Chapek. In 2018, the company's <strong> theme parks hosted over 157.3 million guests, making Disney
                Parks the world's most visited theme park company worldwide, with United Kingdom-based Merlin
                Entertainments coming in second at 67 million guests. </strong> It is by far Disney's largest
            business segment according to employee headcount, with approximately 130,000[7] of the company's 180,000
            employees as of 2015. In March 2018, Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media was merged into
            Parks and Resorts and renamed Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.</p>

                    Disney's Hollywood Studios is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida,
                    near
                    Orlando. It is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks, Experiences and
                    Products
                    division. Based on a concept by Marty Sklar, Randy Bright, and Michael Eisner, the park opened on
                    May 1,
                    1989, as the Disney-MGM Studios (Theme) Park, and was the third of four theme parks built at Walt
                    Disney
                    World. Spanning 135 acres (55 ha), the park is dedicated to the imagined worlds from film,
                    television,
                    music, and theatre, drawing inspiration from the Golden Age of Hollywood.</span>

                    Disney's Hollywood Studios was initially developed as both a theme park inspired by show business
                    and an
                    operating production studio, with active film and television production services, an animation
                    facility
                    branch, and a functioning backlot. Construction on the combined park and studio began in 1987, but
                    was
                    accelerated when the construction of the similarly-themed Universal Studios Florida began a few
                    miles
                    away. To increase public interest and the variety of film representation within the park, Disney
                    entered
                    into a licensing agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), from which the park's original name was
                    derived.</span>

                    The park's production facilities were removed throughout the 2000s, and many of the park's
                    soundstages
                    were retrofitted for newer attractions and guest use. The park's current name took effect in 2008,
                    with
                    the removal of the MGM-branding throughout the park. In the 2010s, the park began to distance itself
                    from the original studio backlot intention and entered a new direction of immersive theming and
                    attraction development inspired by imagined worlds from Hollywood storytellers.</span>

                    when
                    the Sorcerer's Hat—a stylized version of the magical hat from Fantasia—was erected in the park's
                    central
                    hub. The latter then served as the park's icon until its removal in January 2015. Since then, the

                    has been identified and represented in marketing by the Hollywood Tower Hotel, with the Chinese

                    serving as the park's visual centerpiece. In 2018, the park hosted 11.258 million guests, ranking it
                    the
                    fifth most-visited theme park in North America and the ninth most-visited theme park in the

                Disney's Animal Kingdom distinguishes itself from the rest of Walt Disney World's theme parks by
                featuring traditional attractions as well as hundreds of species of live animals. Special designs and
                provisions were incorporated throughout the park to protect the animals' welfare. The park is located on
                the western edge of the resort and is isolated from the other theme parks and properties to minimize
                external disruptions to the animals; as a result, the park's former nighttime show did not feature
                fireworks that would otherwise disturb the animals. In efforts to be more eco-friendly, the park uses
                biodegradable paper straws and prohibits plastic straws, lids, and balloons. Disney's Animal Kingdom is
                accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums,
                indicating they have met or exceeded the standards in education, conservation, and research.</span>
